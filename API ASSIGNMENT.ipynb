    "02:Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "1. Enables easy integration: APIs allow different software systems to seamlessly communicate and interact, making it easier to integrate and connect various applications.\n",
    "2. Enhances functionality: APIs provide access to pre-built functionalities and services, allowing developers to add new features to their applications without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "3. Promotes scalability: By utilizing APIs, developers can leverage external resources and services, enabling their applications to scale and handle increased traffic or demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "1. Dependency on external services: When relying on APIs, your application's functionality may be impacted if the API provider experiences downtime or makes changes to their API.\n",
    "2. Security concerns: APIs can introduce potential security vulnerabilities if not properly secured and validated. It's crucial to implement proper security measures when interacting with external APIs.\n",
    "3. Limited control: When using APIs, you are dependent on the functionality and limitations defined by the API provider. This can restrict your ability to customize certain aspects of your application according to your specific requirements.\n",

    "4:REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two different architectural styles for designing web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: It is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.\n",
    "It emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and statelessness. RESTful APIs utilize URLs to represent resources and respond with data in common formats such as JSON or XML.\n",

    "    Complexity: SOAP can be complex to implement and understand due to its extensive XML-based messaging structure.\n",
